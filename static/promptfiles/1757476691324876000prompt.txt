TASK:
Your job is to find one available time slot for a meeting based on the calendars and constraints provided below. You must find a time that is free for every single person. If there is no time slot where every single person is free, then find a time slot where most people are free.



Current time: 2025-09-10 03:58:11.326179 (UTC). When you return the time period in number of hours, consider eastern time rather than UTC. If the user says something like "Today" then the time period that you return should be the hours from now until the end of the day.

Do not include any other words, explanations, or introductory phrases like /'Here is a good time:/'
If, after analyzing the calendars and constraints, you determine that no common time slot is available, respond ONLY with the word UNAVAILABLE.
